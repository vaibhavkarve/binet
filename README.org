* Introduction
Implement and time functions that produce the n-th term in the
Fibonacci sequence in languages that *I* care about.

The name Binet is a reference to the constant-time algorithm for
computing the n-th term also known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Binet's_formula][Binet's formula]].

This is written as a multi-lingual project with the aim of including
implementations in every language that *I* know, use or care about.
Including implementations in every single language out there is
non-goal of this project.

* Project-wide commands
** TODO: explain the justfile commands
